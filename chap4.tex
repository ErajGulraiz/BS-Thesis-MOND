\chapter{Summary and Conclusion}

Andromeda Galaxy is our nearest neighbour, a spiral galaxy just like the Milky Way, located at about $744$ kpc. This thesis provides a technique to analyze astronomical data and use it to reproduce the rotation curve of Andromeda Galaxy. From Section $3.1$ we saw that the graph optimized only  for velocity shows disagreement with the observed curve, near the centre of the galaxy. When the same graph is optimized for mass, it is quite similar to the one obtained from observed data. We can conclude from this observation that a highly massive body is required at the centre of the galaxy to provide such a high velocity to the bodies in it. This indicates the presence of a super massive black hole at the centre of the galaxy. 

The rotation curve can be further optimized by incorporating the MOND parameter $a_0$. This will be the focus of future work.
