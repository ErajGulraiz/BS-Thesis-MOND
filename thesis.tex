\abstract{The motion of galaxies reveals a considerable discrepancy in the accelerations of their constituent parts. This discrepancy is thought to be  caused by missing matter, and this is known as the Missing Mass problem. There are two solutions to this problem, Dark Matter and Modified Newtonian Dynamics. I have done studied the Modified Newtonian Dynamics in this research by analyzing the rotation curve of Andromeda galaxy reproducing the rotation curve of Andromeda Galaxy. Andromeda Galaxy is our nearest neighbour, a spiral galaxy located at about 744 kpc. The rotation curve was optimized for mass and velocity with $v_{0} = 55802.2453 $ and $m_{0} = 1473818.3329$. We concluded from this that a highly massive body is required at the centre of the galaxy to provide such a high velocity to the bodies in it. This indicates the presence of a super massive black hole at the centre of the galaxy.}
