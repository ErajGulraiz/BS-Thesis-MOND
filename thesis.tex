\acknowledgement{After all the struggles and hardwork of a complete year, now is the time that I pay my gratitude to the people responsible for making this possible for me. I would first acknowledge the dedication and continuous co-operation of my supervisor "Dr. Abid Mujtaba". Thank you sir, for your constant support. With your help and motivation I was able to choose the right direction and successfully complete my thesis.\\ 

I am grateful to my Parents for making me a part of this institution, where i could finally get on the track of my ambitions. Last but not the least I would thank my friends for getting me through the tough times.\\

Thank you!}

\abstract{The motion of galaxies reveals a considerable discrepancy in the accelerations. This discrepancy is thought to a cause of some missing matter, and this idea as a whole is known as the Missing Mass problem. There are two solutions to this problem, Dark Matter and Modiefied Newtonian Dynamics. I have done this research according to the Modified Newtonian Dynamics by reproducing the rotation curve of Andromeda Galaxy using the technique of image analysis. Andromeda Galaxy is our nearest neighbour, a spiral galaxy located at about 744 kpc. The rotation curve was optimized for mass and velocity. Very large values of velocity $v_{0}$ and $m_{0}$ are found out to be $v_{0} = 55802.2453 $ and $m_{0} = 1473818.3329$. We concluded from this observation, that, a highly massive body is required at the centre of the galaxy to provide such a high velocity to the bodies in it. This also indicates the presence of a super massive black hole at the centre of the galaxy to provide enough gravitational force to retain such high velocities.}
